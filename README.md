# The MAGIC/PIC spectra processing

MAGIC provides a website with all related scientific articles and accordingly
(FITS) data files; the service is maintained by the PIC institute, that is why
we call it *MAGIC/PIC* data.

Given the relevance of MAGIC and the scientific mission the group is engaged
-- *i.e*, the study and publication of high-energy astrophysical data --,
we decided to maintain a data base on our own, mirroring their dataset.

The goal of this project is *not*, surely, to simply have the MAGIC data mirrored.
The goal of this project is to have the data properly curated and republish it
through VO-SSAP interface. Data will flow through a pipeline where we will verify
and, whenever possible, automatically fix and filter missing or wrong data.
Eventually, *spectra* that succeeded the automatic analysis will be eye-inspected
and correlated with other, multi-wavelength data in a SED tool.
